A simple **web-based image classification app** built with **Flask** and **Keras**.  
It allows users to upload an image, processes it with a trained CNN model, and returns the predicted class — all through an intuitive web interface.

## 🧩 About

This project integrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, and precisely the VGG19 model (I might change it in the future since this model is kinda overkill for this use case), with a **Flask** backend to classify images in real-time.  
It’s designed as a minimal full-stack machine learning application — a foundation for deploying deep learning models as web services.

### **Key Components:**
- 2 trained **Keras** models (`vgg19.h5` and `sequential_model_cnn.h5`)
- A **Flask API** for serving predictions
- File upload and image preprocessing via **OpenCV** and **NumPy**
- Optional **CORS** setup for cross-origin frontend requests

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Upload any image through a browser or API request  
- ✅ Preprocess image input using OpenCV (resize, normalize, reshape)  
- ✅ Predict class probabilities with trained Keras models  
- ✅ Return results as clean JSON or HTML  
- ✅ Modular and easy to expand for other models or categories  
- ✅ Runs locally with or without GPU (TensorFlow handles fallback)
